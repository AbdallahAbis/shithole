# Shithole/API

Shithole/API provides a secure mechanism for tracking payment information, exposing data for accountability purposes,

For the moment, this is a pretty thin wrapper around [Compensated][compensated-source]. I am hoping to include features like automated refund approval, payment history, and similar things.

## Contributing

See [Shithole's Development Guide][contributing-development].

### Running the API

We recommend using [hivemind][hivemind] or [overmind] to run the API server from [Shithole project root][shithole-root]. This will ensure that the web frontend is also running.

### Running the tests

[There are no tests at this time][you-will-be].
